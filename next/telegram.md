### Telegram Integration: BTFS Made Effortless

We are excited to introduce a new feature coming soon to RentHubâ€”**Telegram Integration**! This feature is designed to make uploading files to BTFS as simple as sending a message to a friend.

For non-technical users who find it challenging to use SDKs or dashboards, this feature will allow them to seamlessly interact with RentHub via Telegram. Here's how it will work:

1. **Send a File to RentHub on Telegram**: Users will be able to interact with a dedicated Telegram bot. Just send your file to the bot, similar to how youâ€™d share a file with a friend.
   
2. **Automatic Processing**: The bot will automatically process the file, deducting the appropriate number of credits from the connected RentHub account.

3. **Seamless Upload**: Once processed, the bot will upload the file to BTFS, and provide a link to the uploaded file directly within Telegram.

This feature is perfect for those who want to skip the complexities of a full development setup. Whether you're managing files from your phone or just prefer the ease of chat-based interactions, RentHub will make BTFS integration more accessible than ever.

Stay tuned for more updates, and donâ€™t forget to visit the Telegram handle once itâ€™s live!
