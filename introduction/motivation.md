The idea for **RentHub** was born out of necessity. Last season, we struggled to find a service that would allow us to effortlessly upload files to BTFS. Specifically, we needed a way to upload JSON data to BTFS through a simple function call in our product. Unfortunately, no existing service met this requirement.

After facing the complexities and challenges of setting up and running a BTFS node ourselves, we decided to create RentHub—a solution that simplifies this process for others. Our goal was to make the cleanest, fastest, and most user-friendly platform to interact with BTFS, and we’ve done just that.

With RentHub, you now have the power to pin any data to BTFS using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface or, for developers, our fast and easy-to-use SDK. Whether you're uploading manually or through code, RentHub ensures a seamless experience from start to finish. (Pro tip: check out the "What Next?" section for an extra surprise!)

At its core, RentHub focuses on:
- **Streamlining file uploads with the SDK**: Easily integrate BTFS into your projects with just a few lines of code.
- **Managing files with the dashboard**: A visual way to track, view, and manage all the files you've uploaded.

By making BTFS accessible for both developers and non-developers alike, RentHub aims to be the best tool for integrating decentralized storage into your product.
