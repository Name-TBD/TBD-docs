> # Credits

**Credits** serve as the internal currency of the RentHub platform, enabling users to upload files and rent BTFS nodes. They can be purchased directly within the platform using TRX (Tronâ€™s cryptocurrency). While the exact pricing for credits is still being finalized, the current process for obtaining credits is routed through the RentHub forum.

### How Credits Work
- **Platform Currency**: Credits are used to pay for file uploads and node rentals on RentHub.
- **Purchase with TRX**: Users can exchange TRX for credits once the pricing structure is fully determined.
- **Temporary Forum-Based Credit Requests**: During the testing phase, users can request credits via the RentHub forum, where our team will manually update your account with the requested credits.

### Testing Phase Credits
As RentHub is still in its testing phase, we are distributing **test credits** to all users. These test credits can be used to explore both the **Rental** and **Dev** modes without any cost implications. Once testing is complete, users will need to purchase credits to continue using the platform.

For now, **Dev Mode** also operates on the credit system, but with test credits available, you can experiment freely with the RentHub SDK and dashboard before the official launch.
