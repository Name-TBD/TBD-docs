> # Introducing RentHub <small>BTFS V1.0</small>

During the development of a recent project, we encountered a significant challenge: uploading files to BTFS required running and maintaining our own node just to deploy data. This process was not only cumbersome but also time-consuming. We searched for a service that would allow us to rent nodes for BTFS, but nothing fit our needs. That's when the idea for **RentHub** was born—a SaaS solution designed to streamline file uploads to BTFS.

**RentHub** eliminates the need for running your own BTFS node. Instead, it offers a simple, user-friendly service that lets you upload files via a clean dashboard or integrate the process directly into your project using our fast and efficient SDK.

For non-Web3 developers, BTFS can present numerous hurdles: running a node 24/7, funding it just to register, and dealing with crypto transactions. RentHub solves all these problems, allowing users to seamlessly rent pre-configured BTFS nodes without the overhead.

### Key Features of RentHub:
- **Effortless File Uploads**: Upload your files to BTFS in under a minute, with real-time insights into your usage and file management.
- **No Node Hassles**: Avoid the complexity of running and funding your own BTFS node. We handle it for you.
- **Seamless Integration**: Use our SDK to easily integrate RentHub into your existing projects, making BTFS accessible even to those unfamiliar with Web3 technologies.

### Target Audience
RentHub is built for developers and individuals who need a fast, efficient way to upload files to BTFS but don’t want the burden of maintaining their own node. Whether you're a developer new to decentralized storage or a seasoned pro, RentHub offers a hassle-free solution.

Our vision for RentHub goes beyond just solving current challenges. For more on what’s coming next, check out the "What Next?" section.
